# Go Notes

## Learn Go - Introduction

### From The Get Go
* Developed by Google
* Sits between low-level & high-level
* Produces code that runs fast and uses **little memory**
    * Has **garbage collection**
* Some **object oriented** features

### Compiling Files
* To make a `.go` file into an executable we need to compile it via the `go build` command
    * E.g. `go build greet.go`
    * After this by doing an `ls` in the directory we can now see that we have an executable called `greet`
```
ls
greet     greet.go
```
* This can be executed via `./greet`

## Running Files
* We can directly run a file instead of the two step process shown above of compilation and then running
    * The `go run` command compiles the code and then runs it
    * But an executable **won't** be created in our directory
    * E.g. `go run greet.go`
* Useful for quick testing of code
