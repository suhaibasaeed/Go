# Go Notes

## Learn Go - Introduction

### From The Get Go
* Developed by Google
* Sits between low-level & high-level
* Produces code that runs fast and uses **little memory**
    * Has **garbage collection**
* Some **object oriented** features

### Compiling Files
* To make a `.go` file into an executable we need to compile it via the `go build` command
    * E.g. `go build greet.go`
    * After this by doing an `ls` in the directory we can now see that we have an executable called `greet`
```
ls
greet     greet.go
```
    * This can be executed via `./greet`
